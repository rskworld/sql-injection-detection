- Machine learning neural network nodes connected in the background, subtly visible
- Lock icons and security symbols around the edges
- A clean, dark blue to purple gradient background with subtle tech patterns

TEXT ELEMENTS (as part of design):
- "SQL Injection Detection" as main title (large, bold, white/light blue)
- "Using NLP & Machine Learning" as subtitle (smaller, lighter)
- Feature highlights: "70+ Features", "134 Training Samples", "Real-time Detection"
- Small icons representing: NLP processing, ML models, pattern recognition

STYLE:
- Modern, sleek, professional tech aesthetic
- Dark theme with neon blue/green accents
- Clean, minimalist design
- High resolution, suitable for hero/banner use
- Vector-style or 3D rendered look

WATERMARK:
- Add "rskworld.in" text in bottom right corner, semi-transparent (30% opacity), small font, white/gray color
- Should be visible but not distracting from main content

COLOR SCHEME:
- Primary: Dark blue (#0a1929) to purple (#1a1a2e) gradient
- Accent: Cyan/blue (#00d4ff), Green (#00ff88), Red (#ff4444)
- Text: White and light gray
```

### Use Case:
- Main project image (sql-injection-detection.png)
- README.md header
- Documentation hero image
- GitHub repository banner

## Image 2: Feature Visualization Diagram

### Prompt:
```
Create an informative infographic-style diagram showing the SQL Injection Detection system architecture and features.

LAYOUT:
- Top section: Input (SQL Query) → Processing Pipeline → Output (Safe/Injection Detection)
- Middle section: Three main feature categories shown as connected boxes:
  1. Lexical Features (18 features) - with icons: text analysis, character counting, entropy
  2. Syntactic Features (25 features) - with icons: SQL keywords, operators, functions
  3. Pattern Features (27+ features) - with icons: attack patterns, encoding detection, security patterns
- Bottom section: ML Models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, SVM) → Final Detection Result

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Flow arrows showing data progression
- Color-coded sections (blue for lexical, green for syntactic, red for pattern)
- Small icons for each feature category
- Statistics badges: "70+ Features", "134 Samples", "99%+ Accuracy" (if applicable)
- Database and security icons
- Neural network visualization in background

STYLE:
- Technical diagram style, clean and professional
- Light background (white/light gray) with colored sections
- Modern flat design or isometric style
- Clear typography, easy to read
- Suitable for documentation and presentations

WATERMARK:
- Add "rskworld.in" in bottom left corner, small, semi-transparent (25% opacity), dark gray color
- Should not interfere with diagram readability

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: White or light gray (#f5f5f5)
- Lexical: Blue (#3b82f6)
- Syntactic: Green (#10b981)
- Pattern: Red/Orange (#ef4444)
- Accent: Purple (#8b5cf6)
```

### Use Case:
- Documentation feature section
- Technical architecture documentation
- Presentation slides
- Project structure visualization

## Image 3: Real-time Detection Workflow

### Prompt:
```
Create a dynamic, interactive-looking illustration showing real-time SQL injection detection in action.

SCENARIO SHOWN:
- Left side: Web application interface mockup showing a login form with SQL query input field
- Center: Processing engine visualization showing:
  - SQL query being analyzed (animated flow effect)
  - Feature extraction process (gears/cogs turning, data flowing)
  - ML model processing (neural network nodes lighting up)
- Right side: Results panel showing:
  - Green checkmark for safe queries
  - Red warning icon for detected injections
  - Confidence percentage display
  - Detailed analysis breakdown

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Split screen showing before/after detection
- Example queries visible:
  - Safe: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1" (green highlight)
  - Malicious: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1" (red highlight with warning)
- Processing indicators: loading animations, progress bars
- Security shield protecting the database on the right
- Attack vectors visualization (arrows showing blocked attacks)

STYLE:
- Modern UI/UX design style
- Semi-realistic with some illustration elements
- Tech dashboard aesthetic
- Clean, professional, engaging
- Suitable for demos and marketing

WATERMARK:
- Add "rskworld.in" in bottom center, small, semi-transparent (20% opacity), white/gray color
- Should be subtle but visible

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: Dark theme (#1e1e2e) or light theme (#ffffff)
- Safe: Green (#00ff88)
- Dangerous: Red (#ff4444)
- Processing: Blue (#00d4ff)
- Accent: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- Text: High contrast for readability
```

### Use Case:
- Demo presentation
- README.md feature showcase
- Documentation workflow section
- Project showcase/portfolio
